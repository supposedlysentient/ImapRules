# ImapRules

IMAP agent that connects to your mailbox and runs mail rules.

You can use filter syntax to match messages and apply actions (e.g. moving the message to a folder).

Use this instead of your mail client's email rules, when:

- your mailbox supports IMAP
- you want to configure your mail rules from anywhere
- you have multiple mail clients and want your rules to run independently
- you want a convenient web UI to manage your rules
- you want your mail rules to be backed by simple human-readable json that you can edit directly
